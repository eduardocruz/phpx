# Overview  
PHPX is an NPX-like package execution tool for PHP that allows developers to execute PHP packages and PHAR files without installing them globally. It bridges the gap for PHP developers working with AI-assisted coding tools and provides a seamless way to try, use, and manage PHP packages across different environments. The next priority is to enhance the user experience by integrating Laravel Prompts, providing beautiful and user-friendly command-line forms.

# Core Features  
- **Package Execution**: Execute Composer packages without global installation
- **PHAR File Management**: Run PHAR files directly with automatic download and caching for known tools
- **Version Flexibility**: Select specific versions of packages and tools
- **Caching System**: Efficient caching for better performance
- **Clean Execution Environment**: Isolated environment for each run
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Integration with Laravel Prompts for beautiful CLI interactions

# User Experience  
- **PHP Developers**: Primary users who need flexibility in package management
- **DevOps Engineers**: Users who need standardized CI environments
- **Team Leads**: Users who want to streamline onboarding and training
- **Key Flows**: Package installation, execution, cache management
- **UI/UX Considerations**: Command-line interface with enhanced user prompts and feedback

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**:
  - Core PHPX Engine: Handles package resolution and execution
  - CLI Interface: Command-line interface for user interaction
  - Laravel Prompts Integration: Beautiful CLI forms and interactions
  - Cache Manager: Handles caching of packages and PHARs
  - PHAR Downloader: Securely downloads and verifies PHAR files

- **Data Models**:
  - Package Configuration: Metadata about packages including versions and dependencies
  - PHAR Registry: Information about known PHAR files and their aliases
  - User Settings: User preferences and configurations

- **APIs and Integrations**:
  - Composer API Integration: For package resolution
  - Laravel Prompts Integration: For enhanced CLI interface
  - File System Access: For cache management and execution
  - HTTP Clients: For downloading packages and PHARs

- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - PHP 8.0+ Runtime
  - Composer
  - File system access for caching
  - Internet access for package downloads

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements (Laravel Prompts Integration)**:
  1. Add Laravel Prompts as a dependency to the project
  2. Create a PromptManager class to handle user interactions
  3. Update core command classes to use Laravel Prompts
  4. Implement interactive package selection with search and filtering
  5. Add progress indicators for long-running processes
  6. Enhance error handling with user-friendly error messages
  7. Add confirmation prompts for destructive actions
  8. Implement interactive cache management

- **Future Enhancements**:
  1. Interactive package discovery interface
  2. Command history and favorites
  3. Project-specific package configurations
  4. Integration with more package sources
  5. Plugin system for extending functionality
  6. Multi-package execution orchestration
  7. Telemetry for usage analytics (opt-in)

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation First**:
   - Add Laravel Prompts as a dependency
   - Create basic prompt abstractions and utilities
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing commands

2. **Quick Wins for Visible Improvements**:
   - Update the most commonly used commands with Laravel Prompts
   - Add progress indicators for package downloads and installations
   - Implement confirmation prompts for cache clearing

3. **Incremental Feature Enhancement**:
   - Enhance package selection interface
   - Add interactive PHAR selection
   - Improve cache management interface
   - Add interactive help and documentation

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Interactive package discovery
   - Command history and favorites
   - Telemetry and usage analytics

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical Challenges**:
  - **Risk**: Laravel Prompts might not work in all terminal environments
    - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback mechanisms for unsupported terminals
  
  - **Risk**: Performance impact from additional UI layer
    - **Mitigation**: Ensure lazy loading of UI components and optimized rendering

  - **Risk**: Backward compatibility issues
    - **Mitigation**: Maintain support for non-interactive mode and existing command formats

- **MVP Scope Management**:
  - **Risk**: Feature creep beyond essential Laravel Prompts integration
    - **Mitigation**: Clearly define MVP requirements and maintain focus on core improvements

  - **Risk**: Over-engineering the prompt system
    - **Mitigation**: Start with simple implementations for common commands before expanding

- **Resource Constraints**:
  - **Risk**: Learning curve for Laravel Prompts
    - **Mitigation**: Allocate time for exploration and experimentation
  
  - **Risk**: Testing across different environments
    - **Mitigation**: Set up automated testing for various terminal types and CI environments

# Appendix  
- **Research Findings**:
  - Laravel Prompts is actively maintained with regular updates
  - The package has excellent documentation on laravel.com/docs/prompts
  - Similar CLI tools have reported significant UX improvements after implementing interactive prompts

- **Technical Specifications**:
  - Laravel Prompts requires PHP 8.1+ 
  - It supports features like text input, password input, select menus, confirmations, multiselect, and progress bars
  - Terminal compatibility includes support for most modern terminal emulators
